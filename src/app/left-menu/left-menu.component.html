        <p class="header"> The situation</p>
        <p> You are to assume the role of the recently appointed Regional Director in Chocó Bliss International (CBI),
          a growing global confectionary company. As part of CBI’s vision to expand its market share over the next 5
          years, the Board is launching a new brand of chocolate bars in the country of Palzag in the next 9 months.
          This range of chocolate bars, which contains 7 different bars with 7 different flavors, should create a big
          impact with its target consumers, who it is intended will switch to this range from other competing products.
        </p>
        <p class="header"> The New range</p>
        <p>7 bars are as follows: </p>
        <ol>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>
          <li> The Dark Chocolate</li>

        </ol>
        <p>This is a premium chocolate candy brand aimed predominantly at female consumers aged 25 years- 45 years. The
          brand character is modern, stylish and prestigious. The chocolate candy is longer lasting; it melts slowly in
          the mouth and has a smooth and creamy flavor that lingers. The cocoa beans are sourced from Mexico, Brazil
          and Peru. </p>

        <p>The Board has asked you to provide your recommendations about the launch of the range by answering few
          critical questions at the end of this case. You recommendations should be as specific as possible and state
          exactly what course of action is necessary. You could make certain assumptions in order to express your
          recommendations, however, state those assumptions clearly in your presentation. Try to anticipate all
          probable consequences of implementing your recommendations and suggest responses to each.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Below, you will find information relating to the market you are operating in, marketing restrictions,
          competitor activities, consumer research and other departments within Chocó Bliss International (CBI).</p>
        <p><strong>Chocó Bliss International (CBI) and Palzag</strong></p>
        <p>CBI is committed to its Vision of producing:</p>
        <p><em>“A portfolio of quality confectionary products, that lead the market in innovation and are valued by
            consumers around the world”.&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>The key objectives for CBI in meeting this vision are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To generate innovative products and marketing campaigns that meets the evolving preferences of its
            consumers.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>To research and develop new leading edge products that has the potential to enhance nutritional value of
            our products.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>To manufacture products in an ethical and responsible way, with consideration for the social and
            environmental impact of the manufacturing process.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
        <p>CBI has grown rapidly in Palzag with the acquisition of existing local brands and its manufacturing
          facilities. CBI has a modern image and is popular with young adults but is, of course, always looking to
          increase market share. The target consumer profile for the range is aged 25 years-45 years; this comprises
          41% male 59% female and predominantly young professionals. Like many countries Palzag has an aging population
          with the number of over 65 years increasing. Females aged 18 years to 45 years buy 80% of all chocolate and
          consume 60%. They are the gatekeepers to the home and buy more expensive chocolate products than males.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Research suggests that as developing countries become more affluent, consumers switch from sugar products to
          chocolate. You have begun to see this transition in Palzag, (which is a developing country), and market share
          should be achieved through natural growth and your superior product offering if your advertising and
          promotions are implemented effectively.&nbsp;</p>

          this new range of chocolate candies could successfully increase CBI’s market share by 5% over the next 18
          months and become the number one confectionary company in Palzag.&nbsp;</p>

            <p class="header">Competitor Activities</p>
            <p>Current research suggests that mass media marketing is not as effective with
              consumers anymore. The premium brand market is increasing in Palzag therefore CBI wants to increase
              market share by encouraging consumers to switch from competitor brands to CBI. Some information on
              competitor activities is outlined below.</p>
            <p class="header">Encore Chocolate</p>
            <p>Encore has just re-launched its premium brand block chocolate in Palzag with a
              limited edition pink packet. It has also been training supermarkets and Point of Sale retailers to
              deliver the core rand message of “Time to Relax” and focusing on the high quality of cocoa beans used. It
              has not increased market share by as much expected.&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="header">Panca Inc.</p>
            <p>Panca has been successful in Point of Sale advertising and information over the
              last 12 months. It has run Value Added Offers, e.g. buy two bars and receive a free trial bar. It has
              also invested in training a number of hostesses to visit supermarkets and answer consumer questions.
              Panca is not expected to run another campaign for its premium brand in the next 12 months and has had
              some problems with fake product copies in the market.&nbsp;</p>

        <p>Below are some key quotes from your target consumers:</p>
        <p><em>“I don’t want to be patronized, I want something different, interesting, and I just
            don’t want to be one of the crowd”.</em></p>
        <p><em>“I have chocolate breaks at work, walk to the open area with colleagues, I get to
            speak to different people on those breaks, learn a lot!”</em></p>
        <p><em>“I tend to buy a chocolate bar from petrol stations and smaller outlets as I want
            one, I don’t buy in bulk”.</em></p>
        <p><em>“If my favorite chocolate bar isn’t there I will try something new, I may pick a
            similar type that I notice on the shelf or try something new. You know the one that stands out”.</em></p>
        <p><em>“I have a few favorite chocolate bars, I might change occasionally but I know what I
            like”.</em></p>
        <p><em>“I am trying to cut down so if I see smaller size bar I will go for that, these,
            king-size ones are too much”.</em></p>
        <p><em>“I hate the hard sell, you need to get to know me, entertain me”.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Key Stakeholders</strong></p>
        <p>There are several departments within CBI that will support the development, production
          and launch of new products. Their input into the product industrialization process is described below.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Product Development- Packaging Innovation</strong></p>
        <p>This department is responsible for the development of new packaging forms and functions.
          It also investigates new printing technologies, new product wrapping opportunities and looks for knowledge
          transfer from other industries. It liaises with machine, base paper and ink suppliers to produce the final
          packaging design. It already has a number of packaging prototypes produced and evaluated for Palzag although
          final sign off is still required.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Product Development</strong></p>
        <p>This department is responsible for the development of new chocolate shapes, tastes and
          fillings. It is currently investigating considerable effort into creating healthier confectionery options
          with
          less salt, sugar and saturated fat. The range of products has already been signed off by the Board.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Brand Marketing</strong></p>
        <p>This department is responsible for developing and proposing strategies and
          corresponding marketing plans for the assigned Brand Portfolio in Palzag. It ensures the implementation of
          plans once they have been signed off in order to contribute to Sales and therefore market share
          growth.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Legal Advisory</strong></p>
        <p>Assess the legal issues regarding local country market legislation. It is typically
          involved at an early stage to identify and advice on any possible barriers in the market, for example
          restrictions regarding confectionary advertising due to government legislation. It also supports the
          Packaging Innovation and Marketing departments during the development process to ensure that the packaging
          and advertising conform to local country legislation. Time needs to be booked with one of the lawyers in
          Palzag to review all the brand’s marketing collaterals. One week of their time should be booked for the
          initial review and frequent meetings with them may be necessary throughout the concept development.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Consumer Research</strong></p>
        <p>Conducts market research into the demographics and requirements of consumers to
          develop a proposed product brief. Conducts market testing of prototype products with target adult consumers
          to confirm the commercial potential before committing to full production of the product. The 7 bars have
          already been tested successfully in Palzag, however, you can request further research if required.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Production</strong></p>
        <p>Responsible for all aspects of the industrialization of the manufacturing process
          once the final chocolate and pack design have been agreed. Manages the implementation of full scale
          production in the chosen production centre. Production of the 7 chocolate bars has already begun in Palzag
          and the pack production must begin shortly.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Supply Chain</strong></p>
        <p>Manages the supply chain from start to finish. Arranges the procurement of cocoa
          beans from farmers along with other ingredients required at the best possible cost. Manages the process of
          shipping chocolate to distribution and wholesale companies, who then pass on the products to retail
          stores.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Sales</strong></p>
        <p>Ensures that products are distributed, made available and sold at the right
          retailers. Develops and implements sales programmes to maximize the availability, visibility and
          merchandising of brands at the Point of Sale. This means building strong relationships with wholesalers and
          retailers. Optimizes the sales force, warehousing and fleet management through efficient use of selling and
          distribution systems and IT solutions. Sales have useful information from the Point of&nbsp;Sale and
          represent CBI and its brands on the front line; it often feels it is consulted too late in a
          campaign.&nbsp;</p>

        <p><strong>Design Agency</strong></p>
        <p>The design agency is external to CBI and creates the visuals for the campaigns in

        <p><strong>Your Stakeholders</strong>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>The Board</strong></p>
        <p>The Board generally agrees on the fact that new and innovative ways need to be
          utilized in order to capture the imagination of consumers and to remain competitive in an increasingly
          aggressive market.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Julien Bliss is the Managing Director and in line with the heritage of the family
          business is passionate about innovation as he believes this to be one of the core factors in the continued
          growth of CBI across the world. He is also keen for all members of the organization to understand the
          confectionary business from idea conception, through product development to sales and execution.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Susie Miller is Sales and Marketing Director. Susie is particularly interested in
          Corporate Social Responsibility and a keen proponent of Marketing in an ethical way whilst highlighting the
          health and nutrition projects CBI is involved in.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>Christopher Barnett is the Director responsible for Research, Development and
          Production. He is particularly interested in current projects into addiction and which ingredients
          consumers crave more, he hopes this new brand could be adapted in the future to include some of his
          research team’s findings.&nbsp;</p>
